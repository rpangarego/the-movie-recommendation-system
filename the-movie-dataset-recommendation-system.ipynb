I bet you already know what it is. Recommendation System is a system that can give you suggestion or recommendation. It's give you recommendation about restaurant, job, video game to play/buy, movies, anything. You usually see it in sites/platform something like \"You might like this\" on some article, \"Similar movie to XYZ\", on Netflix or \"Recommended videos\" on Youtube, it is a recommendation system. In this kernel I would like to build a movie recommendation system (content based).\n\n### About Dataset\nThese files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages. This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.\n\n\nThis dataset consists of the following files:\n\n* movies_metadata.csv: The main Movies Metadata file. Contains information on 45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset. Features include posters, backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, production countries and companies.\n* keywords.csv: Contains the movie plot keywords for our MovieLens movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.\n* credits.csv: Consists of Cast and Crew Information for all our movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.\n* links.csv: The file that contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of all the movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset.\n* links_small.csv: Contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of a small subset of 9,000 movies of the Full Dataset.\n* ratings_small.csv: The subset of 100,000 ratings from 700 users on 9,000 movies.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is an ensemble of data collected from TMDB and GroupLens.\nThe Movie Details, Credits and Keywords have been collected from the TMDB Open API. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb. Their API also provides access to data on many additional movies, actors and actresses, crew members, and TV shows.\n\nThe Movie Links and Ratings have been obtained from the Official GroupLens website.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Import Dataset and Libraries**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd #
